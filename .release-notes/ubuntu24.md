## Add Ubuntu 24.04 support

We've added support for identifying Ubuntu 24.04 and downloading packages for it. As of the time of this release, no release versions of `ponyc` are available- only nightly versions. Release versions of `ponyc` will be available once a version of `ponyc` post 0.58.3 is released.
