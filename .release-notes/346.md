## Enhance architecture detection in Windows install script

Installing `ponyup` on Windows 11 was failing due to a defective download URL: 

```
https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/ponylang/releases/raw/versions/latest/ponyup--pc-windows-msvc.zip
```

Now it downloads from the correct URL:

```
https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/ponylang/releases/raw/versions/latest/ponyup-x86-64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
```
