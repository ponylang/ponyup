## Add macOS on Intel as fully supported platform

We've added macOS on Intel as a fully supported platform. This means that we test ponyup using macOS on Intel and provide nightly and release builds of ponyup for macOS on Intel.

We plan to maintain ponyup as fully supported on macOS on Intel as long as we have a macOS on Intel environment or until Apple stops supporting new macOS releases on Intel CPUs.
