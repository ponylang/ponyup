## Add MacOS on Apple Silicon as a fully supported platform

In August of 2023, we had to drop MacOS on Apple Silicon as a fully supported platform. We had to move off of CirrusCI and in the process, lost access to Apple Silicon builders.

GitHub Actions has introduced M1 MacOS builders and as such, we are happy to announce that ponyup again supports MacOS on Apple Silicon.
