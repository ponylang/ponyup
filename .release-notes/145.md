# Update Dockerfile to Alpine 3.12

The ponyup Docker container has been updated from being based on Alpine 3.11 to Alpine 3.12. This shouldn't be a breaking change for pretty much anyone, but might be if you are using the ponyup image as a base for other images and some package you rely on was removed from Alpine 3.12.
