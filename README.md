# ponyup

The Pony toolchain multiplexer

## Status

This project is currently beta software.

## Usage

### Install dependencies

#### macOS

```bash
brew install libressl
```

### Install ponyup

```bash
sh -c "$(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponylang/ponyup/latest-release/ponyup-init.sh)"
```

### Install Pony

Choose the latest release of the Pony compiler or the latest nightly build.

```bash
ponyup update ponyc nightly
```

```bash
ponyup update ponyc release
```

These commands will download the chosen version of ponyc and install it to `$HOME/.local/share/ponyup/bin` by default. See the instructions below for how to set the install path and manage Pony applications.

### Set install prefix

By default, ponyup will create its root directory in `$HOME/.local/share`. This prefix can be set manually with the `--prefix` (or `-p`) option. All packages selected as default will be symbolically linked into `${prefix}/ponyup/bin`. So, by default, `ponyup update release ponyc` will install `ponyc` to `$HOME/.local/share/ponyup/bin/ponyc`.

### Install a previous package version

You can install any prior release or nightly build available on [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~ponylang/repos/). For example, `changelog-tool` `0.4.0` can be installed with the following command:

```bash
ponyup update changelog-tool release-0.4.0
```

### Show installed package versions

The `ponyup show` command will display the installed package versions with the selected packages marked as green with an asterisk. If a more recent version is not installed, then the more recent version will be shown in yellow following the selected version.

```console
$ ponyup show
stable-nightly-20191116 *
stable-nightly-20191115
ponyc-release-0.33.0-gnu *
ponyc-nightly-20191116-gnu
ponyc-nightly-20191115-gnu
corral-nightly-20191115 * -- corral-nightly-20191116
changelog-tool-nightly-20191116
changelog-tool-nightly-20191115 *
```

The `show` command also has an optional `package` argument to show only the installed versions of the given package:

```console
$ ponyup show ponyc
ponyc-release-0.33.0-gnu *
ponyc-nightly-20191116-gnu
ponyc-nightly-20191115-gnu
```

### Select an installed package as default

The `select` command can switch which installed package version to set as default. Here is an example of switching from ponyc `release-0.33.0` to `nightly-20191116`:

```console
$ ponyup show ponyc
ponyc-release-0.33.0-gnu *
ponyc-nightly-20191116-gnu
ponyc-nightly-20191115-gnu
$ ponyc --version
0.33.0-98c36095 [release]
compiled with: llvm 7.0.1 -- cc (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1) 7.4.0
Defaults: pic=true
$ ponyup select ponyc nightly-20191116
selecting ponyc-nightly-20191116-gnu as default for ponyc
$ ponyup show ponyc
ponyc-release-0.33.0-gnu
ponyc-nightly-20191116-gnu *
ponyc-nightly-20191115-gnu
$ ponyc --version
nightly-20191116 [release]
compiled with: llvm 7.1.0 -- cc (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1) 7.4.0
Defaults: pic=true
```

### Platform options

Ponyup is able to detect the CPU architecture and operating system of the platform on which it is running. The `--platform` option is used to override any field in the platform identifier (e.g. `x86_64-linux-gnu`).

### Common Issues

- Unable to install ponyc:

  ```console
  error: unexpected selection: ponyc-release-x86_64-unknown-linux
  ```

  This is likely caused by a target triple that does not specify the libc ABI for the platform, as detected by `cc -dumpmachine`. The solution is to manually set the platform identifier using `ponyup default <platform>`, where `<platform>` is a platform identifier such as `x86_64-linux-gnu`.
